[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/4ecf8dfe775746f4bc5f3d154a7207df)](https://www.codacy.com/app/tiagofilipe12/PlasmidCoverage?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=tiagofilipe12/PlasmidCoverage&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

For now, this developing branch of this repo provide two versions of the same script:

* Version *PlasmidCoverage.py* maps against only one plasmid sequence. This option is deprecated however you can still use it. Just make sure you install prettytable - `pip install prettytable`

* Version *PlasmidCoverage_Sdb.py* allows users to compile multiple fastas into one or having one multi-fasta file to calculate plasmid coverage. 

In both versions, .gb files are also supported. These files will be converted into fasta files in a subdirectory named "fasta" within the directory the user specifies for plasmid.

## Dependencies
* plotly - ```pip install plotly```
* bowtie2 (tested for version 2.2.9)

You can now simply: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Important note regarding the parsing of argument -r

You should provide the path to the directory containing the directories with the reads (.fastq files). For instance if you have something like `~/Reads/sample1/example.fastq` and `~/Reads/sample2/example2.fastq`, you should provide `~/Reads` as the argument for `-r` option.

### Options for PlasmidCoverage_Sdb.py:

```
**'-p'**,**'--plasmid'**, dest='plasmid_dir', required=True, help='Provide the path to the directory containing plasmid fastas.'

**'-r'**,**'--read'**, dest='read_dir', required=True, help='Provide the path to the directory containing reads fastas.'

**'-t'**, **'--threads'**, dest='threads', default="1", help="Specify the number of threads to be used by bowtie2."

**'-2'**, **'--pair'**, dest='paired', action='store_true', help='Use this option if you have paired end reads. Note that you should append to the end of the fastq file "_pair1" and "_pair2" for the script to be able to recognize both pairs')

**'-k'**, **"--max_align"**, dest="max_align", help="Specify the maximum number of alignments possible for each read. This option changes -k parameter of Bowtie2. By default this script will set -k to the number of fasta files in reference directory (e.g. if you have 3 reference sequences the number of max_align allowed will automatically be set to 3). So, if you have a single multi-fasta -k will be set to 1."

**'-o'**,**'--output'**, dest='output_name', default="plasmid_db_out", help='Specify the output name you wish. There is no need of file extension.')

**'-c'**,**'--cutoff'**, dest='cutoff_number', help='Specify the cutoff for percentage of plasmid coverage that reads must have to be in the output. This should be a number between 0-1.')
```

#### - Acessory tools

**plasmid_or_not.py**

Currently this tool is separated from the main script (PlasmidCoverage_Sdb.py). This script is intended to separate reads from plasmids (or other type of sequences that have a database in fasta format) from reads for mixed libraries of chromosomal + plasmid reads.

###### Options for plasmid_or_not.py
```
**'-p'**,**'--plasmid'**, dest='plasmid', nargs='+', required=True, help='Provide the plasmid fastas'

**'-r'**,**'--read'**, dest='reads', nargs='+', required=True, help='Provide the path to the directory containing reads fastas'

**'-t'**, **'--threads'**, dest='threads', default="1", help="Specify the number of threads to be used by bowtie2"

**'-o'**,**'--output'**, dest='output_name', required=True, help='Specify the output name you wish. No need for file extension! Output file will be a fasta.'

**'-unmap'**,**'--unmapped'**, dest='unmapped_reads', action='store_true', help='By default this script attempts to save sequences available in the provided read files. If you want to save the reads that do not belong to plasmids, use this option.'
```

**diffs_json.py**

Currently this tool is separated from the main script (PlasmidCoverage_Sdb.py). This script compares two json files with coverage percentage per gi (json files retrieved by PlasmidCoverage_Sdb.py.

##### Options for diffs_json.py
```
**-i**,**--input_jsons** - Provide the input json files of interest.

**-c**,**--cutoff** - Provide the cutoff value used for the minimum coverage allowed to be outputed to json files. This value should be equal in both files to compare.
```
